# Components Folder Structure

To maintain a clean and organized `components` directory in your Next.js project, create subfolders corresponding to specific features or pages where the components are used. Place all related components within these subfolders to keep them modular and easy to manage.

This approach helps prevent clutter and makes it easier to locate and reuse components across your project.

## Example

If you have components related to the `About` page and a `ContactForm`, organize them like this:
/components 
- /About 
 - TeamCard.tsx 
 - MissionSection.jsx
- /Contact ContactForm.
 - jsx MapEmbed.jsx

# Public Folder Structure

To maintain a clean and organized `public` directory in your Next.js project, create a subfolder corresponding to each page in your application. Store all public assets (images, videos, etc.) related to that page within its designated folder.

This approach helps prevent clutter in the `public` directory and makes it easier to manage assets for individual pages.

## Example

If you have a page at `/about`, create a subfolder `public/about` and place all related assets there.
/public 
- /about 
 - team.jpg 
 - mission.png 
- /contact 
 - map.png
